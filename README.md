# IoT
Like Apple Home Kit, but free and for raspberry-pi. Control everything in your house with one click from your smartphone.

Change the function 
```js

```
to use whatever gpio you'd like (I2C, ...)

Runs on localhost (for raspberrypi / windows)

If you download you agree to https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

If you want to change the password, change it here:

```js
var passwd = '1234'; // Change 1234 in what you'd like
```


Change also the gps.position file

Uses NGROK if you want to change something or toggle something in your house, when you're not at home
